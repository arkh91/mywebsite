	<h1>CSS Animations</h1>
	<p style="font-size: 24px;">CSS animations allows animation of most HTML elements without using JavaScript or Flash!</p>



	<h2>There are three key advantages to CSS animations :</h2>

	<li> They are easy to use for simple animations; you can create them without even having to know JavaScript.</li>
	<li> The animations run well, even under moderate system load. Simple animations can often perform poorly in JavaScript. The rendering engine can use frame-skipping and other techniques to keep the performance as smooth as possible.</li>
	<li> Letting the browser control the animation sequence lets the browser optimize performance and efficiency by, for example, reducing the update frequency of animations running in tabs that aren't currently visible.</li>

	<h2>Resources</h2>

    <h2>Animation property</h2>
    <div class="ani_prop_padding">
    The sub-properties of the animation property are:<br><br>

    <strong>animation-name</strong><br>
    Specifies the name of the @keyframes at-rule describing the animationâ€™s keyframes.<br>
    <strong>animation-duration</strong><br>
    Configures the length of time that an animation should take to complete one cycle.<br>
    <strong>animation-timing-function</strong><br>
    Configures the timing of the animation; that is, how the animation transitions through keyframes, by establishing acceleration curves.<br>
    <strong>animation-delay</strong><br>
    Configures the delay between the time the element is loaded and the beginning of the animation sequence.<br>
    <strong>animation-iteration-count</strong><br>
    Configures the number of times the animation should repeat; you can specify infinite to repeat the animation indefinitely.<br>
    <strong>animation-direction</strong><br>
    Configures whether or not the animation should alternate direction on each run through the sequence or reset to the start point and repeat itself.<br>
    <strong>animation-fill-mode</strong><br>
    Configures what values are applied by the animation before and after it is executing.<br>
    <strong>animation-play-state</strong><br>
    Lets you pause and resume the animation sequence.<br>
