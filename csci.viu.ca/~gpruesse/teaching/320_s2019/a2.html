<b>Objective</b><br>
<blockquote>
To problem-solve within the particular constraints of limited 
computational models: Push-Down Automata and Context-Free Grammars.
<br>
To develop understanding of the models and to create algorithms.
<br>
To foster understanding of 
determinism and non-determinism, and develop the ability to 
critically assess, and to create, effective, rigourous, and concise 
arguments and proofs.

<b>Task</b><br>
<blockquote>
<ol>
<li>
(10 marks)
Prove that the following language is not regular, by 
using the Pumping Lemma.  You can use the closure theorems if you wish.

<br>
L<sub>0</sub>
={a<sup>i</sup> 
b<sup>j</sup>| 
j &le; i &le;2j}.

<li>
(10 marks)
Prove that the following language is not regular, by 
using the Pumping Lemma.  You can use the closure theorems if you wish.

<br>
L<sub>1</sub>
={w &in; {a,b,c}<sup>*</sup>| 
the first letter to appear in w is not a most numerous letter }.
<br>
For our purposes, a letter is most numerous is there is no letter
that occurs more often in the string.  For example, 
if w = ababccba, then both 'a' and 'b' are most numerous, as they 
   occur three times each in w, whereas 'c' is not most numerous, as 
   it occurs just two times in w.
<li>
(10 marks)
Give a context-free grammar for the 
language 
L<sub>2</sub>
={a<sup>i</sup> b<sup>j</sup>
| 3i = 4j-1, 
i, j &ge; 0}.
<li>
(10 marks)
Give a natural PDA for the language of the previous question.
<li>
(10 marks)
Give a CFG for the language
L<sub>3</sub>
= {a<sup>i</sup>
b<sup>i+j</sup>
c<sup>j</sup> | i, j &ge; 1 }.

<li>
(10 marks)
Give a natural PDA for the language of the previous question.
