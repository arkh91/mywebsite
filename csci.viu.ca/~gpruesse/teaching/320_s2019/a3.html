<b>Objective</b><br>
<blockquote>
To problem-solve within the particular constraints of limited 
computational models: Push-Down Automata and Context-Free Grammars.
<br>
To develop understanding of the models and to create algorithms.
<br>
To foster understanding of set cardinality, countable and uncountable sets, 
and how to prove cardinality claims about sets.

<b>Task</b><br>
<blockquote>
<ol>
<li>
(15 marks)
Give a <b>natural</b> PDA and a CFG for the language L, where
L={w &in; {0,1}<sup>*</sup>: |w| is even and the first half of 
w is not the same as the second half of w}. 
For example, aabaab is not in L, but aababb is in L. 


<li>
(10 marks)
Prove that the class CFL is closed under string reversal.
<li>
(10 marks)
Give a bottom-up parser for the language generated by the following grammar.  
Use the construction.

<br>
S&rarr; aSdd | aSd | X
<br>
X &rarr; bXc | bbXc | &epsilon; 

<li>
(5 marks)
What language is generated by the grammar given in the previous question?
For full marks, give a formal but simple definition.
<li>
(10 marks)
Give a top-down parser for the language generated by the following 
grammar.  Use the construction.

<br>
S&rarr; AXD
<br>
X &rarr; bX | &epsilon;
<br>
A &rarr; aAb | &epsilon;
<br>
D &rarr; bDc | &epsilon;

<li>
(10 marks)
Let W = { (i,j,k): i,j,k &in; N }, where N is the set {1,2,3, ...}. 
Prove that W is countably infinite.

<li>
(10 marks)
Let Z = { s: s is an infinite sequence of letters from the set {a,b,c} }. 
Prove that Z is uncountably infinite.
