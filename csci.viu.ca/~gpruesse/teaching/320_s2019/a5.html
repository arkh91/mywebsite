The proof that SAT reduces in polynomial time to 3SAT 
involves a method to write any CNF clause as a logically equivalent 
3SAT boolean formula.  Use the method to construct a 3SAT equivalent

Due Friday April 5. 
Consider the problem WEIGHTY_CYCLE(&lt;G,w,K&gt;| G=(V,E) is a graph, 
w: E&rarr; Z<sup>+</sup> &cup; {0} is a weight function on edges, and 
there exists a cycle of weight K or greater in G }.
<br>
The weight of a cycle is the sum of the weight of the edges in the cycle.
<br>
Prove that WEIGHTY_CYCLE is NP-complete.  
Remember to first prove it is in NP.
<br>
<br>
Notes about this question:
<br><br>
      Questions 4 and 5 of A5 are due on Friday.  
      <br>
      For the WEIGHTY_CYCLE question, you can assume that the 
      following problem is NP-complete:
      <br>
      <br>
      HAMCYCLE = {&lt;G&gt; | G is a graph, and there is
      a cycle that visits each vertex of G exactly once}.
      <br>
      <br>
      Note that the graph in HAMCYCLE is undirected and no weights are assumed on the edges.
      <br>
      <br>
      For the WEIGHTY_CYCLE language, the cycle in question must be 
      simple (visits no vertex or edge more than once); note that WEIGHTY_CYCLE does not require that EVERY vertex be visited.  The weight function
      w which is part of the input is simply saying each edge, say (u,v), 
      has a weight on it, denoted w(u,v).  
      An example of a weighted graph is below.  If that graph's encoding
      is &lt;G_example1&gt;, then the string &lt;G_example1, 18&gt; is 
      in the language WEIGHTY_CYCLE, because there is a simple cycle in the 
      graph where summing the weights on the edges yeilds 18 or greater --
      specifically, a,b,c,e,a is such a cycle.
