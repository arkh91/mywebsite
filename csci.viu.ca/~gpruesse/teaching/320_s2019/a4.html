<li>
(15 marks)
Give implementation description (5 marks) and a state diagram of a Turing Machine (10 marks) that decides 
the language {$w &in; {a,b,c}<sup>*</sup>| #<sub>a</sub>(w) = 
#<sub>b</sub>(w) = #<sub>c</sub>(w)}. Examples of an implementation description of a TM and a state diagram of a TM are given in the text for Example 3.7. 
Note that the string on the input tape will begin with a "leftmost cell" 
marker, the $ sign.  This is placed there so that you can easily 
scan back to the beginning of the string.  It makes your machine smaller.
<li>
A Turing Machine (TM) is a 7-tuple, and with a little work 
we could agree on a convention for representing TMs as strings 
over an alphabet.  For example, we could agree that 
the alphabet is 
{q,0,1,(,),",",L,R,S,ha,hr,_}, 
and we could use this alphabet
to encode a simple 3-state TM over an alphabet of size 4 as follows:
<br>
<br>
((q10,ha,hr),
(11),
(101),
((q00,00,q01,01,R), 
(q01,00,q00,01,L),...,(q10,10,10,ha)),q00,ha,hr).
<br>
<br>
The above encoding can be interpreted as follows:
<br>
<br>
((q10,ha,hr), // implies the state set Q={q00,q01,q10,ha,hr}
<br>
(11), // implies input alphabet is &Sigma;={00,01,10,11} 
<br>
(101), // implies tape alphabet &Gamma; is &Sigma; &cup; {100,101} &cup; {_ } (the blank symbol)
<br>
((q00,00,q01,01,S), // transition &delta;(q00,00)=(q01,01,R)
<br>
(q01,00,q00,01,L),...,(q10,10,ha,10,R)),q00,ha,hr). // more transitions, start state, halt-accept and halt-reject states.
<br>
<br>
It is easy to see that any TM could be encoded in this way. For a 
TM M, we will let &lt;M&gt; denote the encoding of M in the manner 
described above.  (Note that M is a TM, whereas &lt;M&gt; is 
an <em>encoding</em> of M.)
<ol>
<li>
(5 marks)
Do you think the language 
{ &lt;M&gt; &in; {q,0,1,(,),",",L,R,S,ha,hr,_}<sup>*</sup>| M is a TM }
is Turing-recognizable? Is it Turing-decidable?  
Give a brief argument saying why you think so. 
You do not need to provide a formal proof, but you should
give directions as to what such a proof would contain -- a 
high-level description of what such a proof would consist of.
<br>
<li>
(10 marks)
Show that 
{&lt;M&gt; &in; {q,0,1,(,),",",L,R,S,ha,hr,_}<sup>*</sup>| M is a TM }
is Turing-enumerable -- i.e., there is a printer-TM for it.
</ol>
<li>
(10 marks)
Is the langauge 
R = {&lt;M,w&gt; | M is a TM that rejects string w } decidable, or recognizable, or neither? 
Say which of the three options you think is true.  
If R is decidable, prove it by giving a TM that decides the language. 
If R is recognizable but not decidable, prove both those things -- give a 
TM that recognizes the language, and prove that some undecidable 
language reduces to R.
If it is not recognizable, prove it.
<li>
(10 marks)
Is the language
Forever = {&lt;M,w&gt; | M is a TM that runs forever on input string w } decidable, or recognizable but not decidable, or not recognizable? 
Prove it.
