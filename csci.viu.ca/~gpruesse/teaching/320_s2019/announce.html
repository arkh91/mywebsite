      Due to the snow days, the Test 2 will 
      be on the following days, in Tutorial:
      <br><b>Test 2 CFLs:</b> March 5 
      <br>
      <br>Regarding Assignment 3.  Question 1 is pretty challenging.
      (Note that I have updated the Question to ask for a NATURAL PDA for the 
      language, not a top-down or bottom-up parser.)
      Some students have even said it can't be done!  But fear not -- you
      have not been assigned an impossible task.  
      It's true that the <b>complement</b> language is not Context-Free (CF) -- it is the 
      language of all strings that either have odd length or are of the form ww (first 
      half equals last half).  Note, however, that a language can be CF while its 
      complement is not, and that is the case here.
      Some hints might be useful, 
      and I provide them here.
      <br>
      <br><b>Hint 1</b>: 
      First, solve it for all even length strings.  Then see if your solution handles 
      odd length strings correctly, and adjust if not.
      <br>
      <br><b>Hint 2</b>: 
      In order for a string of length 2n to be of the form ww, 
      it must be the case
      that <b>for all</b> i&le; n, 
      w<sub>i</sub>= 
      w<sub>i+n</sub>.  [Here 
      w<sub>i</sub> denotes the ith letter in the string w.]
      What is the <b>negation</b> of that claim -- is it a "for all" or "exists" quantifier?
      Formulate a mathematical characterization of the negation of the "for all" claim; 
      make your new claim begin with a quantifier 
      (&exist; or &forall;); i.e., it should not begin with negation.  Recall that
      &not; &forall; can always be rewritten as a &exist;, and a &not; &exist; can be rewritten
      as a &forall; -- if you don't know how to do that, then see the bullet for 
      De Morgan's Laws for quantifiers on 
      <a href="https://www.cs.sfu.ca/~ggbaker/zju/math/pred-quant.html">this page</a> (just 
      before the Nested Quantifiers section).
      <br>
      <br><b>Hint 3</b>: 
      You will need non-determinism.  Suppose your answer to Hint 2 is an existential quantified claim.
      Are you postulating the existence of two letters in the string?  How many letters apart
      are they?  How can you use a PDA to ensure they are exactly that far apart?

      Questions 4 and 5 of A5 are due on Friday.  
      <br>
      For the WEIGHTY_CYCLE question, you can assume that the 
      following problem is NP-complete:
      <br>
      <br>
      HAMCYCLE = {&lt;G&gt; | G is a graph, and there is
      a cycle that visits each vertex of G exactly once}.
      <br>
      <br>
      Note that the graph in HAMCYCLE is undirected and no weights are assumed on the edges.
      <br>
      <br>
      For the WEIGHTY_CYCLE language, the cycle in question must be 
      simple (visits no vertex or edge more than once); note that WEIGHTY_CYCLE does not require that EVERY vertex be visited.  The weight function
      w which is part of the input is simply saying each edge, say (u,v), 
      has a weight on it, denoted w(u,v).  
      An example of a weighted graph is below.  If that graph's encoding
      is &lt;G_example1&gt;, then the string &lt;G_example1, 18&gt; is 
      in the language WEIGHTY_CYCLE, because there is a simple cycle in the 
      graph where summing the weights on the edges yeilds 18 or greater --
      specifically, a,b,c,e,a is such a cycle.
