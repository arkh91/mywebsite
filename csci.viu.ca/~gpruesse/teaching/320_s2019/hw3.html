<b>Task</b><br>
<blockquote>
The problems are in the 3rd edition of Intro to the Theory of Computation, by Sipser.
<ol>
<li>
1.16 (b)

After we have covered the Pumping Lemma, do the following. Note that 
the answers are provided for some questions.

<!-- <li>
%For each of the following languages, show either that it is regular or
%that it is not.  That is, come up with a NFA or r.e. for the language, 
%or give a Pumping Lemma proof that it is not regular.
%Let the alphabet in all cases be {a,b}.
%<ol type="a">
%<li>
%{w | the number of a's in w is twice the number of b's} 
%<li>
%{ba<sup>i</sup>ba<sup>j</sup>ba<sup>i+j</sup>w | i &ge; 0, j &ge; 0, and w &in; {a,b}<sup>*</sup>}
