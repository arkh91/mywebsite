<center><h4>CSCI 162 Spring 2018: Prolog Lists Lab</h4>
<br>
</center>
For this lab, write the following predicates in a file called lists.pl.  
<ol>
<li>
Write a list predicate called ismember(X,L) that is true if X is in the list L, false (ununifiable) otherwise.
<br>
(We did this one in class; try to do it yourself, as a warm-up exercise.)
<br><br>
<li>
Write a list predicate called remove(X,L,L1) that removes the first 
instance of X in L, leaving L1.
<br><br>

<li>
Write a list predicate called removeAll(X,L,L1) that removes 
all instances of X in L, leaving L1
<br><br>
<li>
Write a list predicate called attach(X,L,LX) where LX is the list that results from attaching X to the end of L.
<br><br>

<li>
This next task will lead towards a prolog predicate that
computes the dot-product of two lists of 
numbers that are of equal length.  First, let's write
a predicate dp that assumes the lists are of equal length
and computes the dot product, putting that list in
as the third argument.
<br><br>
Write a list predicate called dp(L1,L2,L3) 
so that if L1 and L2 contain numbers, 
then L3 = [L1[0]*L2[0], L1[1]*L2[1], etc].
dp will
assume that L1 and L2 are two lists of same length.
<br>
Use number(X) to make sure that the list element is a number before 
using arithmetic operations on it.
<br>
<br>
Now dp will be your helper routine for a prolog predicate you 
will call dotproduct(L1,L2,L3).  dotproduct will ensure that 
L1 and L2 are of the same length, and then call dp(L1,L2,L3).
length(L,X) is a built-in predicate, you don't have to write it.
<br>
<br>
<li>
Write a predicate max(L1,X) that places the maximum value in the list L
into the variable X.  On an empty list it should just fail.
Note that >= can be used for "greater than or equal to".
What happens when you hit semi-colon repeatedly after you have found the 
max?  Try it on the list [1,4,3,8,3].

<br><br>
<li>
If you have time,
use max and remove to implement a sort routine.
You will have to call it mysort, as sort is a built-in function.

</ol>
