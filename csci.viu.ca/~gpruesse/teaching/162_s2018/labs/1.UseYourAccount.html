<br> 
</center>


The "lab" in the first week of classes is actually an activity 
you can execute any time in the first week.  

<br>
<br>
You should:
<ol>
<li>
Get a key card to enable you to enter the lab room, which is 315/102.
Follow the directions <a href="https://scitech.viu.ca/computing-science/computing-resources#Card_Key_Access">here</a>.
<li>
Log in to your otter account.  You must have your login id and password from
last term, or get them from your instructor or from Jim Uhl, the 
Technician for Computing Science.  His office is 315/212.  Naturally, we
will not give login id and passwords out over the phone or via email.
You will have to bring your student card.  
<br><br>
Once you have your login id and password, enter them into the top-right 
login window on the screen at a computer in Room 102. Enter them with no
leading spaces.  Once you have correctly entered them, you can explore the 
environment (Linux), or you can logout.

<br><br>
If you are logging in for the first time with the password given to you
by the department, then you will be required to change that password
right away.  Usually it does that right in the login window, 
prompting you to enter a new password, which you must enter twice; then
it is changed. It is a bit picky, so do this rather carefully -- no 
leading spaces, etc.  Passwords are case sensitive.
</ol>

That's it!  That's all you have to do for the lab in the first week of 
classes.
