  <h1>
   OS Lab: Linux files and directories; a couple of good editors; and some
   more advanced Linux commands.
  </h1>
  <p>
   The purpose of this assignment is to explore Linux commands, file systems, and shell scripting.
  </p>
<p>
<ol>
<li>
Do you have a directory for your 162-related material?  If not, create it
using "mkdir 162" or "mkdir csci162". Change directory into your CSCI 162 directory using
the cd command, as in "cd 162" or "cd csci162". 
<ol>
<li>
In your 162 directory, you will make a new directory called labs/oslab1.
First, try the command "mkdir labs/oslab1".  Does it work?  If not, try 
"mkdir -p labs/oslab1".  The -p option indicates that the parent directories should also be made.  For example, the command "mkdir -p level1/level2/level3" will make 
a directory level1 in the current directory, and in level1 will be a directory level2, and so on.
<br>
<b>While in your oslab1 directory, use the -p option for mkdir to make level1/level2/level3.</b>
<br>
cd into level1/level2/level3
<br>
create a file f1 by typing the following
<pre>
cat > f1
this is a test
ctrl-d
</pre>
Now type "cat f1" and press return.  You should get your text 
back, i.e., "this is a test".  The command above redirected 
concatenation ("cat") into a file you called f1; and ctrl-D 
terminated the "cat" operation and closed the file.
<br><br>
Now in a single cd command, change directory back up to level1.
("cd ../..")
While in this directory, execute this: 
<pre>mkdir -p level2a/level3a
</pre>
Do a ls; then cd down to level3a. Do ls; you should see that there
is nothing there. 
<br>
cat the file f1, without using cd.  How do you identify the file using
a relative path?  Note that, in cd, '.' means the current directory, 
and '..' means the parent directory.  Therefore, to cat f1, you
can enter the following command:
<pre>
cat ../../level2/level3/f1
</pre>
Now cat that file into a new file you will call f1a
<pre>
cat ../../level2/level3/f1 > f1a
</pre>
Now type ls to see what is in the current directory.  Type pwd to see the 
path to the current directory.
<li>
<b>cd</b> back into oslab1, in whatever manner you wish.
<br><br>
Click on the following link to a text file, and grab the text in the 
files (Ctrl-C). 
<br>
You will now drop the text into a file that you create, by doing the 
following:
<br>Type this command on your command line:<br>
<b>cat > einstein1.txt
<br></b>
Now drop the text that you grabbed previously, using Ctrl-Shift-V. 
<br>
Everthing you type now will go into the file einstein1.txt, 
until you Ctrl-D.
Add some of your own text by typing anything, then Ctrl-D.
<br>
Copy the files <a href="os/einstein1.txt">einstein1.txt</a> and 
<a href="os/einstein2.txt">einstein2.txt</a> into this directory, 
using the <b>cat</b> command.
<li>
Copy the files <a href="os/sun1.txt">sun1.txt</a>, 
<a href="os/sun2.txt">sun2.txt</a> and 
<a href="os/sun3.txt">sun3.txt</a> into this directory.
</ol>
<br>
<br>
<li>
In most Linux systems, there are several ways to create
a file.
<br>
<ol>
<li>
Using the <b>touch</b> command:
<pre>
gpruesse@otter:~$ ls my-file
ls: my-file: No such file or directory
gpruesse@otter:~$ touch my-file
gpruesse@otter:~$ ls -l my-file
-rw-r--r-- 1 gpruesse users 0 2017-10-02 21:22 my-file
gpruesse@otter:~$ touch my-file
gpruesse@otter:~$ ls -l my-file
-rw-r--r-- 1 gpruesse users 0 2017-10-02 21:23 my-file
</pre>
Here the command touch creates an empty file if the file does not already exist and it only changes its modification
date if it does. The command ls lists all the files and directories that are under the directory you are
in. The option -l displays different aspects of the files being listed. (See below)
<li>
Using the <b>cat</b> command:
<pre>
gpruesse@otter:~$ ls my-file
ls: my-file: No such file or directory
gpruesse@otter:~$ cat > my-file
</pre>
The > sign directs the following into the file.
<pre>
This is the first line.
This is the second line. 
^Cntrl-d
</pre>
Terminate with Cntrl-d.
<pre>
gpruesse@otter:~$ cat my-file 
</pre>
Without the > sign, it concatenates the file to "standard-out" filestream -- i.e., it prints contents of file to the screen.
<pre>
This is the first line.
This is the second line.
gpruesse@otter:~$ cp my-file my-file2
gpruesse@otter:~$ cat my-file my-file2
This is the first line.
This is the second line.
This is the first line.
This is the second line.
gpruesse@otter:~$ cat my-file my-file2 > my-file3 
</pre>
The >  sign redirects into a file
<pre>
gpruesse@otter:~$ cat my-file3
This is the first line.
This is the second line.
This is the first line.
This is the second line.
</pre>
cat is a command that assumes different functions in different situations. It can be used
<br>
(a) to create files,
<br>
(b) to concatanate files, meaning to add two or more files consecutively,
<br>
(c) or to just simply display a file.
<br>
<br>
<li>
Using an editor. The most popular editors are emacs, vim (or vi), nano, pico and nedit but there are
many more. My favorite editor is vim, but many people like emacs because it is
extremely powerful and flexible.
<br><br>
Below are examples of how to manipulate a file using emacs and vi.
<br><br>

Emacs :
<br>
(a) Invoke emacs.  The current version on otter has a nice graphical interface, so that you can
choose your actions from drop-down menus easily.
<pre>
gpruesse@otter:~$ emacs my-file &
</pre>
The & sign places a job to the background.  If you don't put the 
ampersand at the end of the emacs command, the terminal window
will run emacs in the foreground, in which case you won't be able 
to run other commands from it.
<pre>
[1] 4771 
</pre>
At this time, an external window should pop up.
<pre>
gpruesse@otter:~$ jobs
[1]+ Running xemacs my-file &
</pre>
(b) In the window that opens, type in the text normally as if you were typing in a Word document.
<br>
(c) It's good practice to save your work often while using an editor, so click on the third icon from the left
on the toolbar on top of screen. Editors, in particular emacs usually allows tasks to be performed through
keyboard shortcuts, which are key combinations that speed up typing. Saving your work in emacs or xemacs
can be done by the key combination Cntrl-x Cntrl-s.
<br>
(d) Next, we are going to create a third line that is almost identical to the other second line, except we'll
replace the word "second" with the word "third". For this go to the beginning of the second line and type
Cntrl-k. This will cut the text and store it in a sort of a clipboard. Then type Cntrl-y once to undo the
cutting of the second line, press enter to go on to the next line and then type Cntrl-y again to form the
third line.
<br><br>
Now, you are at the beginning of the third line. Go to the end of the word 
"second" and Alt-Backspace.
This action erases entire words instead of erasing them letter-by-letter.
You can now finally type the word "third".
<br><br>
Make sure to save again! As long as you don't save your work, it won't actually get written to disk and
will be lost when you close your emacs session.
<br>
<br>
(e) You can alternatively do all this by using the various menus and icons on the top of the screen. However,
learning keyboard shortcuts using emacs allows you much flexibility and speed. A complete list of keyboard
shortcuts is basically impossible but a concise collection can be found at various pages on the web :
<ul>
<li>http://www.cs.duke.edu/courses/fall01/cps100/emacs.html
<li> http://www.engr.uvic.ca/ dastone/emacs-keys.html
<li> http://naveen.wikidot.com/emacs-commonly-used-shortcuts
For the time being, it’s sufficient for you to do a few basic exercises using emacs. 
</ul>
<br><br>
Vi :
<ol>
<li>
Invoke the editor vi.
<pre>
gpruesse@otter:~$ vi my-file
</pre>
There's no need to send vi to the background because unlike emacs, it opens the editor in the terminal and not
in an external window.
<li>
vi has two modes : the insert mode and the command mode. The insert mode lets you type 
into the file, while the command
mode is for actions such as removing line, moving the cursor around and yanking text. In order to type into the
file, type i. This will take you into the insert mode. You can then type text normally.

<li>
After you are done typing, you need to save your work before exiting. For this, type Esc. This is allow you to
exit the insert mode and go into the command mode. Now, type :, you will see it appear at the bottom of the
screen. If you would like to save and quit the file, type x. If you would like to save and continue working, type
w. If you, instead, want to quit without saving changes, type q!. The ! forces quit without saving.
</ol>
<br><br>
<b>Pico</b>
<br><br>
<ol>
<li>Pico doesn't have modes so you can type right away.
<li> Some keyboard shortcuts in pico are the same as those in emacs. You can for instance use Cntrl-k to cut a
line. Yanking a line, however, has a different binding, namely Cntrl-u.
<li> Once you are done writing, you can either type Cntrl-o and save without exiting or Cntrl-x to exit, which will
prompt you to save the file.
<li> The good thing about pico is that it lists relevant actions at the bottom of the screen although I find its
capabilities rather limited in comparison to emacs.
</ol>
</ol>
<br><br>
<h3>More Linux Commands</h3>
<br><br>
<ol>
<li>
The <b>man</b> command
<br><br>
"man" is linux for "manual".  You can request the manual pages for 
a linux command, say "grep", by typing
<pre>
man grep
</pre>
on the command line.  If you want all the man pages that 
mention a certain word, like "print", type the command
<pre>
man -k print
</pre>
There's rather a lot, and it scrolls past quickly.  
To get it to show you a page at a time, pipe the command into "more".
The pipe is the |, and it is like a pipeline, directing the output 
of one command (in this case, the text output from the "man -k print"
command) into another command (in this case "more", which is exactly 
like the "less" command, as in less is more ;-).  Use it and see 
what more does to text.  Hit the spacebar repeatedly; what happens?
When you've seen enough, you can use 'q' to
quit "more".
<br><br>
Type the command "history", and see what shows up.  Again, you might 
have too many commands in your history, so use the up arrow to get 
back the last command ("history") and pipe that command into "more".
Hit spacebar until you've seen 500 commands or you are back in the present.
<br><br>
<li><b>
Comparing files : diff
<br><br>
</b>
Suppose you have two files that are almost the same but you know that there are a few differences between them. You
would like to know these differences and where in the file they occur. 
The files einstein1.txt and einstein2.txt
that you copied earlier both contain similar text with a few different words in each paragraph. First let's just see a
brief account which says whther the two files differ.
<pre>
gpruesse@otter:~$ diff -q einstein1.txt einstein2.txt
Files einstein1.txt and einstein2.txt differ
</pre>
Now let's see the lines where they differ. For this we'll simply invoke the diff command without any options.
<pre>
gpruesse@otter:~$ diff einstein1.txt einstein2.txt
9,10c9,10
< Jack Rosenberg remembers the time Einstein’s coworker asked him to
< turn the tables and help give the famous scientist a present.
---
> Jack Rosenberg remembers the time Einstein’s colleagues asked him to
> turn the tables and help give the famous scientist a gift.
</pre>
.....
You'll see that the differences are given line by line together with line numbers.
Sometimes, it is useful to see the differences in context, meaning displaying the differences with some lines around
it. This is especially valuable if your text is sparse and it's 
hard to understand the location of the differences without
seeing what's around it. This function can be invoked using the -U option. You can decide how many lines you want
to be displayed around the lines with differences.
<pre>

If you have time during the lab, explore awk, head, tail, and more on the 
pipe, in the following section.
<br><br>
<li>
<b>Extracting information from files : awk, head and tail; the pipe
<br><br>
</b>
Suppose we have a file that contains several columns. We'd like to display the first three lines of items that are on
the ninth column of this file. Download the file 
<a href="os/columns2.txt">columns2.txt</a> 
from the web.
First let's learn how to display the first N lines of a file. You can do this using the command head. As you might
have noticed by now, Linux commands usually have eccentric names... The default number of lines displayed with
head is 10, however, you can override this by specifying the number of lines you would like to be displayed.
<pre>
gpruesse@otter:~$ head -3 columns2.txt
(first three lines appear here)
</pre>
This is almost what we want except we would like only the ninth column (i.e. the numbers column) to be displayed.
We do this using a command called awk. awk is really a pattern searching language in itself, which is very helpful for
certain tasks. awk is ordinarily used to extract columns from files in the following way :
<pre>
gpruesse@otter:~$ awk '{print $5}' columns2.txt
(this is not the data in columns2)
-1090.13343774
-1090.20757070
-1090.24296462
-1090.25563488
-1090.27085564
-1090.27693129
-1090.28213580
-1090.29131927
</pre>
In awk and in a lot of shell scripting, the direction of the quotation marks is very important. Whatever’s inside
the ´{ }´ is interpreted as the instruction given to awk, which in our case is to print the fifth column of the file,
designated by $5.
However, this isn’t what we wanted to do. Instead of displaying the fifth column of the entire file, we are only
interested in displaying the fifth column of the first three lines. A very common construct in Linux when we want
to process the outcome of a command using a second command is the pipe, which is the vertical line |. Instead of
having awk read from a file, we can pipe the output of head to awk directly without having to save it to a file first.
<pre>
gpruesse@otter:~$ head -3 columns.txt | awk '{print $5}'
(this is not the data in columns2)
-1090.13343774
-1090.20757070
-1090.24296462
</pre>
Note that the first part of the pipe, namely the one starting with head is a full command with the file name, whereas
the second part does not have the file name as the argument anymore.
To add a final complication, let’s say that we are interested in displaying only the fifth column of the second line
of this command. We can do this by adding another pipe with the command tail. The usage of tail is very much
like that of head except that it displays the last N lines of text.
<pre>
gpruesse@otter:~$ head -2 columns.txt | awk '{print $5}' | tail -1
(this is not the data in columns2)
-1090.20757070
</pre>
The action head -2 displays the first two lines, awk then selects the fifth column of the output and finally tail -1
displays the last line of the second output. You can form a chain of pipes of arbitrary length in this way.
Create your own data file of column data by cd-ing up to the top directory, 
and executing the command "ls -l > ~/162/labs/oslab1/column.txt" or 
"ls -l > ~/csci162/labs/oslab1/column.txt", depending on what you called your
directory.  That is, give  a valid path name to your csci162 labs subdirectory for this lab.

Go to the directory you have the files sun1.txt, sun2.txt, sun3.txt and sun4.txt.
First make sure that
you have all the files and that they are not empty by using the ls command.

Perhaps you are not interested in seeing all the files in your directory but those which start with the word "sun".
<pre>
gpruesse@otter:~$ ls -l sun*

-rw-r--r-- 1 gpruesse users 2640 2007-09-18 22:46 sun4.txt
</pre>
Or equally, you want to view just those files which have a .txt extension.
<pre>
gpruesse@otter:~$ ls -l *.txt

The asterisk(*) is called a wildcard and it is used to list files that start with, end in or contain a given pattern.
Now that we are convinced that the files exist and they are not empty, let's take a look at one of them. When
you try to use the command cat like we did before, you will see that the file is too long to fit into a single screen.
What would be nice is to be able to control the portion of the file that is shown on screen. This can be done with
the command less.
<pre>
gpruesse@otter:~$ cat sun3.txt
</pre>
...... Runs off the screen!

dark in the middle of the day. The stars come out. The animals and birds
think it's time to sleep. And you can see the solar corona. It is well
worth a major journey.

gpruesse@otter:~$ less sun3.txt

the Earth but the region from which a total eclipse is visible, called the
path of totality, is very narrow, just a few kilometers (though it is
sun3.txt lines 1-23/32 69% 
</pre>
Scroll using up and down arrows.
Next, let’s count the number of lines, words and bytes in the file sun2.txt. This can be done using the wc command,
which stands for word count.
<pre>
gpruesse@otter:~$ wc sun2.txt
96 1086 5976 sun2.txt
</pre>
Doing research, we often find ourselves looking for a particular word or a pattern in a given file. This could be, for
example, energy or result. While this search can be done by visual inspection if the file is small, for larger files, this
would be impossible. Linux has a very powerful command, grep, for conducting pattern search. It takes as arguments
the pattern being searched and a file name. If called without any options, it prints lines containing the pattern on
the screen. Suppose we want to know the number of times the word "sun" occurs in the file sun2.txt.
<pre>
gpruesse@otter:~$ grep Sun sun2.txt
The surface of the Sun, called the photosphere, is at a temperature of
about 5800 K. Sunspots are "cool" regions, only 3800 K (they look dark only
.....
</pre>
Calling grep with the option -n causes the number of the line to be displayed where the given pattern occurs.
<pre>
gpruesse@otter:~$ grep -n Sun sun2.txt
1:The surface of the Sun, called the photosphere, is at a temperature of
2:about 5800 K. Sunspots are "cool" regions, only 3800 K (they look dark only
.....
If we are only interested in the number of occurrences of the pattern, we can use the -c option.
<pre>
gpruesse@otter:~$ grep -c Sun sun2.txt
</pre>
You might have noticed that grep not only finds the instances of the word "sun" but also words which "sun" is a
part of, such as "Sunspot" (Notice also that grep is not case-sensitive, but that can be modified through options).
Suppose now that we would like to count all occurences of the word "Sun" but not Sunspot. This can again be
achieved by piping the output of the grep from above to a second grep, this time using the -v option, which matches
nonoccurences of the given pattern. Because we are only interested in the number, we can do a further pipe to wc, as
before.
<pre>
gpruesse@otter:~$ grep Sun sun2.txt | grep -v spot | wc -l
</pre>
