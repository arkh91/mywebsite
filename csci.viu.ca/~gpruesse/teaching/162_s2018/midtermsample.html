<h2>NAME:_______________________________________________________________</h2>



<ol>
<li>
For the Digital Display Unit (the Seven-Segment Display) 
we are interested, in this question, in the 
boolean function for the <b>top left vertical</b> segment.  Note the following: 
<ul>
<li>
the inputs are w,x,y,z, where w represents the most significant bit and z the least 
significant bit
<li>
valid inputs are four-bit sequences that are binary representations of integers between
0 and 9. For example, since 1001 is the representation for 9, when the application
requires that '9' is to be displayed,
w=1, x=0, y=0, and z=1 are sent as inputs to the circuit.
<li>
invalid inputs are not assumed to be ever be sent to the circuit, and we don't care 
whether the circuit turns the segment on or off for invalid inputs
<li>
the circuit should be '1' or ON when the input is the binary representation of a number which, 
when written to a seven-segment display, needs the top left vertical segment to be lit up.
<li>
a '1' written to the display should correspond to lighting up the two vertical bars on the RIGHT.
</ul>

<ol>
<li>
(4 marks) Give the Truth Table for the top left vertical segment.
<li>
(6 marks) Draw the Karnaugh Map for the top left vertical segment, and give the
resulting minimum sized boolean function for this segment.
<li>
(3 marks) Draw a circuit for the top left vertical segment that is two layers: some AND gates, all
of which feed into an OR gate.  The gates can have more than two inputs.  The literals are 
all available in negated and unnegated form -- i.e., there is an input w and an input w'
and similarly for all the other variables.  Your circuit should minimize the number of "gate inputs".
</ol>

</li>

<br<br>
<li>
(2 marks) Give the decimal representations of the numbers whose binary representations are
1110101 and 1001001.
<br><br>
<li>
(1 marks) Give the binary representations, and the three-digit hexidecimal representations, 
of the numbers whose decimal representations are
987 and 460.  
<br><br>
<li>
(2 marks) Give the binary representation of the number whose decimal representation is 45.32.
Suppose we have 11 binary digits of accuracy, and you can simply place the radix dot (".")
in the binary string.  Use no leading 0's, but use trailing 0's if necessary. For example, 
decimal 1.5 would be 1.1000000000)
<br><br>
<li>
(4 marks)
Suppose we have six binary digits for our two's complement representations.  Express the c
following as an addition of two's complement numbers, and tell whether overflow has occurred: 
<pre>
     -12
   +  -7
   = -19

</table>
(10 marks)  Write a MARIE assembler code program that does the following:
<ul>
<li>
prompts the user for 
decimal integers X, Y, and Z, and 
<li>
invokes a subroutine (i.e., function) AplusBminusC with X, Y and Z provided as its parameter values; 
the subroutine places 
the "returned value" into a variable called ReturnedValue.  Retain the input values (i.e,
keep X, Y, and Z unchanged.  
<li>
outputs the Returned Value.
<li>
Invoke the subroutine AplusBminusC with the parameter values X+Y, Z, Y.

</ul>
You will also write the subroutine (i.e., a function) AplusBminusC that takes as its 
parameters Param1, Param2, Param3 and computes Param1 + Param2 - Param3, and 
places the result in ReturnedValue.
</li>

<br><br>
<li>
(2 marks) Describe multiprocessing.

<br><br>
<li>
(4 marks)
There are computers everywhere, including simple devices that do not have multiprocessing but
may nevertheless require a simple operating system.
Would virtual memory have any usefulness if the system is a device with no multiprocessing?
Discuss.

<br><br>
<li>
(1 mark)
Give a linux line command that will compute the differences between the files program1.cpp and 
program2.cpp and store those differences in a file called programdiff.  Use the diff command.

<br><br>
<li>
(1 mark)
Give a linux line command that will cat two files f1 and f2 into third file f3.  

<br><br>
<li>
(12 marks)
Suppose you have the following prolog fact file that describes the links among nodes 
in a computer network.  
If otter has a link to capitan then otter can send data to capitan. 
We use link(otter, capitan) to say there is a link from otter to capitan.
<pre>
link(otter,capitan).
link(capitan, discovery).
link(discovery, ubc).
link(ubc, otter).
link(discovery, uvic).
link(uvic, otter).
link(uvic, olds).
link(olds, uvic).
link(otter, toronto).
</pre>
Some nodes in the network are municipalities; some are universities.
<pre>
municipal(toronto).
municipal(victoria).

university(otter).
university(capitan).
university(discovery).
university(olds).
university(uvic).
university(ubc).
</pre>

<ol>
<li>
(2 marks) 
Suppose the above facts have been loaded into the Prolog interpreter.
Write the query you would make (i.e., what would you type into 
the Prolog interpreter) to find out what the links are that go out from 
otter?  How would you find all of them?
<li>
(2 marks)
Write a predicate "bilink(X,Y)" that is true if there is a X-Y link and 
a Y-X link.
<li>
(5 marks)
Every node
can send data to itself; to send data to other nodes there must be 
a succession of links that lead to the destination.
For example, in the above facts, there is a otter-capitan link,
and a capitan-discovery link, so "connected(otter,discovery)" would
return "true", because otter-capitan-discovery is a path of links.
Define the predicate "connected" that takes as parameters two nodes, and 
is satisfied (true) if the is a path of links from the first node  
to the second node -- you could send data from the first node to the second
node (perhaps visiting intermediate nodes on the way).  
<li>
(2 marks)
Write the predicate "munconnected(X,Y)" that is true if X and Y are connected using only municipal links -- i.e., the intermediate nodes must be 
municipal, not university, nodes.  The endpoints need not be 
municipal, but the intermediate nodes must be.
