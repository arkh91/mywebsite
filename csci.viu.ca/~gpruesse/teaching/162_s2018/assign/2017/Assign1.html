Boolean Circuits and Binary Representation

<b>Submission deadline:</b> 1:30  pm, Tuesday Jan 31, 2017.</b>
(Between 1 and 1:30 I will be in my office to receive submissions; at
1:30 I will be in the lab and will recieve submissions for the first 5 minutes.)

<b>Assignment submission:</b>
<p>
Problems should be neatly presented on paper. Hand in, or place under my door.

<p><b>Questions:</b>
This page contains both homework questions, which the student should use to practice, 
and Assignment questions, which the students should hand in. 
Practice questions can be taken up in class.  Students 
may discuss Assignment Questions, and may be informed 
by such discussions, but when a student writes the submitted work 
the student must do so without the aid of any relic of any 
conversation, communication, or outside source that gives directly
the solution or partial solution to the problem, unless explicitly permitted by 
the Assignment document. 
<ol>
<li>
(5 marks Assigned)
Draw the digital circuit that expresses the boolean formula f(x,y,z)=((x+y'z)(y+x'z'))'
<li>
(5 marks Assigned)
Give the truth table for the formula in Question 1.
<li>
(5 marks Assigned)
In class, we proved using a truth table that y + y'z = y + z.  Prove the
same using the Boolean Algebra theorems given in class.
<li>
(Homework) Build a two-bit Adder, based on the half-adder given in
class. It will have four inputs, x1 x0 and y1 y0, where x0 and y0 
are the least significant digits of x and y, respectively.  There are
three outputs, z2 z1 and z0.
<li>
(10 marks Assigned)
For the Digital Display unit as given in class, give the Karnaugh Map
(including showing the blocks for "and" gates in a minimum-input circuit)
for the left-bottom-vertical display bar.  Show the "don't care" values 
as X in the map.  Give the boolean formula and the circuit diagram for 
the result. Report how many inputs are in your circuit.  All literals
are present "for free" -- i.e., negated inputs are available without 
requiring NOT gates.

Given the following:
<br>
11011+11001
<br>
the answer, and the interpretation of what the question is, will be
different depending on whether binary or twos-complement representation
is assumed.  Report the decimal notation equivalent of the question, and 
the answer, of the sum under assumption of binary representation, and 
of twos-complement representation.
<li>
(5 marks Assigned)
Write a MARIE assembler program that takes as input three integers 
and outputs the value of the largest.
Test it on the MARIE simulator.  Report three such test cases you have
executed on the simulator that test different conditionals.  Report the 
answer found in each such case.
