<p><b>Questions:</b>
Students 
may discuss Assignment Questions, and may be informed 
by such discussions, but when a student writes the submitted work 
the student must do so without the aid of any relic of any 
conversation, communication, or outside source that gives directly
the solution or partial solution to the problem, unless explicitly permitted by 
the Assignment document. 
<ol>
<li>
Consider the following MARIE program.

<br><br>
<pre>
   clear 
   Store answer
   input 
   store num
   input 
   store maxj
loop, Load answer
   Add num
   Store answer 
   Load num
   Add one
   Store num
   Load j
   Add one
   Store j
   Subt maxj
   Skipcond 800
   Jump loop
   Load answer
   Output
   Halt

num, dec 0
j,   dec 0
maxj,   dec 0
one, dec 1
answer, dec 0
</pre>

a) (1 mark)  Give the answer that is output when the inputs are: 1, 3
<br>
b) (1 mark)  Give the answer that is output when the inputs are: 0, 11
<br>
c)  (5 mark) Give a short program in C++ that is equivalent to the
program given.  By equivalent, we mean that 
it computes the same thing and it uses the same method or algorithm.
When writing it in C++, 
express the algorithm naturally in C++, using the C++ constructs.

<b>Solution:
<p>
The solution is given below.  Concepts where students exhibited incomplete understanding 
are the following:
<ol>
<li>
Most students did recognize that the concept of having contiguous 
memory locations which are accessed by the program by incrementing 
the start address corresponds to an array.  
<li>
The values in those memory locations were given in hex, and MARIE uses
two's complement representation, so the values with a 1 
in the most significant digit of a 16-binary-digit representation are
negative values. (Test yourself: what do you look for in a four-hex-digit
representation to see if the first BINARY digit is a 1?  Does 9A21 have a 
leading 1 or leading 0 in the 16-binary-digit representation?)
<li>
While the word "loop" is just a label in the MARIE program, it is in 
fact used in the program, in conjunction with the skipcond statement, as a location
in a loop-style program structure; since the skipcond is conditional on
the value of the most recently read array element, it suggests a "while" 
loop.  Several students thought it was a "for" loop structure, ranging 
on the six values in the array, but in fact the loop stops before it 
handles all the array elements; it stops when it encounters an 
array element that is less than 0. 
<li>
The work done within the loop is equivalent to adding the array elements
to an initially zero variable X, until a negative array element is 
found.
</ol>
<pre>
int Array[]=[84, 32, 10, -1, 21, -24415];
int X=0;
int i=0;
while (Array[i]>0) {
   X=X+Array[i];
   i++;
   }
cout &lt; &lt; X;
</pre>

<li>
Write the following Prolog predicates.  Test them
on the Prolog interpreter, and hand in typed or handwritten Prolog predicates.
<br>

a) (1 mark) Give the predicate "append(L1,L2,L3)", where L3 is the result
of appending list L2 to the back of list L1.  
You don't have to reinvent it; you can look it up in the Prolog Wikibook (link on the web page), or 
get it from your notes.  The object of this 1 mark question is 
to ensure your familiarity with Prolog recursive predicates.
<br>
b) (4 marks) Give a prolog predicate that takes a list and counts the number
of elements in the list.  The predicate will be size(L,X), where 
L is a list and X is the number of members of the list.
<br>
<br>
c) (6 marks) Give a prolog predicate that takes a list and halves it into 
two sublists, the front end and the back end. The predicate will be 
halves(L, LF, LB).  If the list is of odd length, the front half will
be the longer half.  Use the predicate append, which we looked at in
class and is covered in the Prolog Wiki, and use the size predicate. 

<pre>

<!-- <br><b>Solution: You can try them on otter using prolog.  If you want 
to use prolog on your own computer, I suggest swipl which is freely 
downloadable, but it sometimes gives different answers to otter's 
prolog version, and otter's prolog will be our standard. </b>

<br>
<b>No.</b>

<br>
<b>No.</b>

?- magic(wizard).

<b>No.</b>
<li>
?- magic('McGonagall').
<br>
<b>Yes; 'McGonagall' is a witch, and every witch is magic.</b>
<li>
?- magic(Hermione).
<br>
<b>Yes. Hermione is a variable, so the goal is satisfied when Hermione 
is set to be any atom that is magic, such as 'McGonagall'.</b>
