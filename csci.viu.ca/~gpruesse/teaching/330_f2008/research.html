<center><h4>CSCI 330 Individual Research Papers</h2></center>
The individual research paper is worth 20% of the final mark,
(15% for the final written paper and 5% for an oral presentation of the paper).
<p>
The goal is to investigate a particular aspect of programming languages
that is not covered in the regular course material,
present a summary of the investigation to the class, 
and submit a formal paper discussing the topic.
<p>
This is a research project, so you are expected
to investigate your topic through the use of current journals,
available conference papers, appropriate sites on the WWW, and any other
pertinent sources you can find for information.
<p>
Examples of possible topics include:
<ul>
<p><li> A detailed study of a specific language not covered in class.  Some of the
   languages covered in past papers include
    Ada, Awk, Basic/VB, Cobol, Eiffel, Fortran, Forth, Haskell, ICON, J2ME, Limbo, Lua, 
    Lucid, Modula, Oberon, Objective-C, 
    Pascal, Perl, PL/1, Python, REXX, Ruby, Smalltalk, Snobol, etc.
   <p>
    Note this must be a reasoned analysis of the language, not simply a recital of the syntax
    and semantics of the language.  The specific choice of language <em>must</em> be approved by
    the course instructor.

<p><li> A detailed study of programming language issues for a particular form of programming, 
   e.g.
  <ul>
  <li> artificial intelligence systems
  <li> cgi programming
  <li> graphics
  <li> game programming
  <li> microprocessors or embedded systems
  <li> parallel or distributed computation
  <li> real time systems
  <li> etc
  </ul>

<p><li> A detailed study of how different languages handle some aspect of programming, e.g.
   <ul>
   <li> compilers, interpreters, and partial compilation
   <li> data representation
   <li> debuggers and development environments
   <li> efficiency and optimization
   <li> maintainability (readability, writability, etc)
   <li> memory management
   <li> templates
   </ul>

<p><li> A detailed study of particular forms of language construct across a wide range of
    representative languages.  Again this must substantially diverge from or expand on any
    coverage provided in the course lectures and textbook.  The specific choice of construct
    <em>must</em> be approved by the course instructor.

</ul>

<p>
<b>Selection of topic:</b> you must submit a (hardcopy) outline of your 
chosen topic by 11:30am on Nov 4.  This outline should be about 300 words,
describing your chosen topic, research plan, and resouces.  This outline
<em>will</em> be copied and 
used as part of the basis for assessment of your final paper.
(I.e. if you later decide to switch topics you <em>must</em> come discuss
it with me for approval first, submitting a revised outline when you do so.)
<p>
<b>Written reports</b>
<p> 
Hardcopies of the written reports must be submitted by 5:00 pm on December 2nd.
 - electronic submission of the research paper will NOT be accepted.
They must be no more than 10 pages double spaced (at most 2500 words) (abstract and attached code does not count in the maximum length limit), 
must be word-processed (no hand-written
documents will be accepted), and should include sufficient background and
explanatory information to be readable by a typical third-year computing
student.  Because effective communication is a crucial part of both 
systems analysis and general professional development, 
spelling, grammar, and readability
will all be considered in the grading of the submission.
<p>
The reports should be laid out in an acceptable fashion for technical reports,
complete with abstract, introduction, suitable division into sections and
subsections, conclusions, and list of references cited in the report.
If you need advice on the preparation of such reports, a link to style guides 
<a href="http://csciun1.mala.bc.ca:8080/~wesselsd/csci330/writing.html"> from Dave's web page </a> may be useful.


<p>
<b>Oral presentation</b>
<p> 
The presentations will be carried out in class in the final two lectures
and the final day of labs. 
<see the <a href="pressched.html">presentation schedule page</a> 
for details.
<p>
The presentations should be 10 minutes in length, not including about 2-4 minutes
for class questions following each presentation.
<p>
The mark for the oral presentation will be based on the instructor's
assessment and on evaluations submitted by those
attending the presentations.  The evaluations will cover
<ul>
<li> how well the presenter seemed to know their topic
<li> the clarity of explanations
<li> the visual effectiveness of the presentation
<li> the presenter's handling of questions
<li> the effectiveness of the verbal presentation
(speed and clarity of speech, timeliness, looking at the audience, etc)
</ul>
<p>
<b>Advice:</b> the presentation should be geared towards your audience.
Provide enough background and enough details so the audience can clearly
understand the salient points of your project, but don't get bogged down
in details your audience will find tedious or distracting.
<p>
<b>Late penalties:</b> late papers will be accepted till Dec 8 
at a penalty of 10% per day, and 20% per weekend, of the total possible mark
for the submission.  
No papers will be accepted after that point.
<p><b>No late presentations will be accepted</b> - you must deliver your
presentation in your scheduled time slot or you will receive a mark of 0. 
<p>
<b>Collaboration:</b> the research papers are to be individual efforts - no 
collaborative work is permitted.
