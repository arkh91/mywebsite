Dave's <a href="http://csciun1.mala.bc.ca:8080/~wesselsd/csci330/scheme.html">Quick Reference</a>.
<p><p>
The following <a href = "lab6.scm">file</a> is provided.  Cut and paste it into a file.
<b></b>
<p><p>
<ol>
<li>
The Scheme function "apply-to-all", which we covered in class, is in the file 
provided.  Use it to square every integer in a list.
<p>
<p>

</li>
<li>
Also provided are functions allowing you to define trees, with left and right
children and data in the node.  
<p>
What does the node function return?  Examine the code in the file.
Explore by defining, in the
interpreter, a tree t2 with one left child and no right child. 
What is returned when you type (t2 0)?  (t2 1)? (t2 2)? (t2 3)?
</li>
<li>
Write a function called size which takes 
a tree and returns the number of nodes in the tree.  
Test your size function.
</li>
<p>
<li>
Write a search function that takes a key value and a tree in BST order and  
returns the node containing a key if the sought-after value is
a key in the tree; () otherwise.
Test is by writing a function called found that returns true if the key 
is in the tree, false otherwise.
</li>
<p>
<li>
Write a function called traverse that traverses the tree and outputs 
the data values in inorder.
</li>
