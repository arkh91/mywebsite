Dave's <a href="http://csciun1.mala.bc.ca:8080/~wesselsd/csci330/scheme.html">Quick Reference</a>.

The following <a href = "lab6.scm">file</a> was provided for lab6.  You were to cut and paste it into a file, or copy it from 
<br>
csciun1.mala.bc.ca:8080/~gpruesse/public_html/teaching/330/labs/scheme/lab6/lab6.scm.

<li>
Add to your file of 
tree functions the function build-tree, which takes a list and builds a tree of 
the elements of the list.  The tree should be in Binary Search Tree order -- keys
less than the root are in the left subtree, and keys greater than the root are
in the right subtree.  
<p>
You may want to write, as a helper function, a function that inserts a new key into
a given tree.  If you have <b>insert</b> and <b>fold</b>, how can you write build-tree?  
Fold is given as
<pre>
; fold operator f over l, where f has identity id
(define fold (lambda (f l id)
  (if (null? l) id
      (f (car l) (fold f (cdr l) id)))))
</pre>
Fold takes a function f, a list, and the identity value for the function -- for example, 
the identity value of + is 0 (because `+0' is the identity function) and the 
identity value of * is 1 (because `*1' is the identity function) -- and returns
the result of applying f iteratively to the list of elements.  For example, 
(fold + `(5 2 1) 0) is (+ 5 (+ 2 (+ 1 0))). 

</li>
<p><p>
<li>
Add to your file of tree functions the function inorder, which takes a tree and
makes a list of the data in the tree in inorder traversal order. (This may be
similar to your traverse function.)
</li>
</l>

For example, if you were to call
<tt>
(inorder (build-tree `(3 9 77 2 19 1 6)))
</tt>
mzscheme would respond with 
<tt>
(1 2 3 6 9 19 77)
</tt>
