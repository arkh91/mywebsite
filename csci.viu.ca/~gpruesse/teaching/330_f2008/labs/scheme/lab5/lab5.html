Use Dave Wessels' <a href="http://csciun1.mala.bc.ca:8080/~wesselsd/csci330/labs/2007/scheme.html">Scheme Quick Reference</a> in the following.  To find out more about Scheme, including downloading it, see <a href="http://csciun1.mala.bc.ca:8080/~wesselsd/csci330/scheme.html">this page</a>.

<ol>
<li>Review the sections the Scheme Quick Reference that deal with Type Checking 
and with Selection Statements.  
<p>
Write a Scheme program that prints out "Enter a list:" and then 
gets input from the user and, if it is a list,
prints out "List is " followed by the list.  
<p>
If its not a list, it prints
out "That's not a list!"

</li>
<li>
Review the section Creating Your Own Functions.  
<p>
Write a Scheme function 
that takes an integer and a list, and returns a list of the same elements
except that any elements that are numbers of value less than the given integer
have been removed.
</li>
<li>
Change your solution to Part 1 so that, upon loading your "lab5.txt"
file, the Scheme interpreter asks for a list; if the input is not a 
list, the interpreter sends an error message; otherwise it prompts for an integer value; then it displays the list that results from culling all 
numbers less than that value from the list. 
</li>
<p>
<p>
<li>
What does Scheme do if you want to add to a variable that currently contains a
character?  a string?  a list?  This question will form part of Assignment 2.
