<b>Lists in Prolog</b>
<p><p>
1. Write a Prolog program that sorts a list. 
It should be called by the following query:
<p>
sort([3, 19, 2, ... 70], X).
<p>

2. 
Here is a simple Prolog program to generate the ways of making change for a dollar.

<pre>
change([H,Q,D,N,P]) :-
	member(H,[0,1,2]),          /* half-dollar */
	member(Q,[0,1,2,3,4]),      /* quarters */
	...
	S is 50*H + ...
	S =< 100,
	P is 100-S.

</pre>
Finish off the code so that you can query various ways of making change for a dollar.
<p>
Try out trace to see how Prolog backtracks.

2. In Prolog, enter the facts necessary to describe the tree on the board by
defining all the necessary parent relations, and then defining child using
parent.

<p>
Now write the predicates to compute the depth of a node.

<p>
Computing the height is trickier, and may require the use of "setof", which is different in this Prolog compiler.  Give it a try if you wish. 
(The height is the 
length (in edges) of the longest path to a leaf.)
