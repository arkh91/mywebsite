<br> 
<br></center>
<br> 

For this lab, you will use the data in
<a href="family">family</a> 
to test your prolog programs.  
You can get it using the following command:
<pre>
cp ~gpruesse/public_html/teaching/330/labs/prolog/lab2/family
</pre>


You are to write the following:
<p><p>
1. sibling(X,Y)
<p><p>
2. brother(B,X)
<p><p>
3. sister(B,X)
<p><p>
4. grandparent(G,X).
<p><p>
5. cousin(C,X).  Neither self nor sibling is a cousin.
You can use the operator `not(P)', which will be satisified
only if P is not -- e.g., 
<pre>
male(X):- not female(X).
or
male(X):- not(female(X)).
<p><p>
6. ancestor(X,Y).  I am my own ancestor, and every ancestor of my parent is also my ancestor; nobody else is my ancestor.
<p><p>
<b>Lists in Prolog</b>
<p><p>
8. Write a Prolog program that finds the maximum in a list. 
It should be called by the following query:
<p>
max([3, 19, 2, ... 70], X).
<p>

About Prolog lists:
You can refer to the head and tail (the head is an element, the tail is a list which is the remainder of the list when the head
is removed) by formatting it in your structure.  For example, 

<p><p>
<pre>
sum([], 0). 
sum([H], H).
sum([H|T],X) :- sum(T,Tailsum), X is H+Tailsum.
</pre>
<p><p>

The symbol '|' in the square brackets breaks the list up into
the head (an element) and the tail (a list).  If the list is empty,
when this is done, you'll get `No' -- i.e, it cannot be satisfied.
.  However, notice that 
there is a sum clause, above, that deals with the empty 
list; Prolog will check the clauses in order, so it
will check the first clause first, and will only
try the others if so far it is unsatisfied. 

<p><p>
Now you can refer to H and T in your 
structure.  H and T are just variables.  We could have used 
X and Y. 
<p><p>
Note: no typechecking is done in the above.  It is a good idea to
do typechecking using number(X). For example, sum could be:
<p><p>
<pre>
sum([], 0). 
sum([H], H):- number(H).
sum([H|T],X) :- number(H), sum(T,Tailsum), X is H+Tailsum.
</pre>
