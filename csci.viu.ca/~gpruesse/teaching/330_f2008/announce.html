Sept 26: The words "inherited" and "intrinsic"
to mean different things.  Consequently I will change the question from 
the assignment to say "synthesized" and "inherited"; we will discuss these issues in the review session 
on October 7, before the midterm on October 9.
Also, the words "arithmetic expression" were missing from the html page, for the ssame question.  They now
appear.

Sept 22: Sorry, folks: I came in on Saturday to post the assignment, but csciun1
went down while I was doing so.  Anyway, it will appear in the next few hours, under the <a href="assign"> Assignments </a>link on the 330 web page.  
The cryptic message below is meant to indicate that Edition 8 p242 question 11 
is the same as Edition 7 p 246 question 11, and is on the assignment.  Also, Edition 8 p 241 question 8 is the same as Edition 7, p244 question 8, and is on the
assignment.

Sept 19: Question 11 of Chapter 5, p 246, is the same as one of the assigned questions.

Sept 18 -- Lab 1: write a sort routine -- but you must name it something other than 
sort, since sort is a built in function.  So call it sort1.
