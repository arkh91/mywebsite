<br><br>Course Outline</small></h2>

<b>Course Motivation and overview</b><br>
This course will cover a selection of subjects from algorithm design
and analysis.  Algorithms, and the data structuring they require, 
are the soul of computer
science.  One important job of the computer scientist is to 
understand the
requirements for a proposed system and, if possible, come up with a
way to get the computer to function as desired -- to solve the instances
of the given problem, if and when possible.  How do we do this?
<br><br>

As a student in this fourth-year computer science course, you are by now familiar with 
many algorithms -- that is, you'll 
have seen the end result of other's inspired search for algorithmic 
solutions to computer science problems.  Likely you will also
have devised algorithms of your own.  In this course we seek to
develop algorithmic sophistication, by expanding the range and depth
of understanding of classic and innovative algorithms with an
emphasis on how to find the appropriate problem-solving paradigm for a
given problem, and by offering opportunities
for you to devise and analyse algorithms of your own.

<br><br>
<b>Topics</b><br>
The topics to be covered in the course are not, at the time of this
writing, set in stone; they 
will be selected based on the following factors: What is useful?  What 
prepares the student for creative problem solving?  What are the things that 
ever computer scientist should know?  What is interesting?  What is fun?
<br>
<br>
To those ends, we may be selecting some topics from among the following 
list. Some of these topics have already been introduced to the students in
earlier courses, in which case we will be deepening and expanding on the
problems and their solutions.

</li><li> Office hours (in Bldg 315, Rm 218): Wed 9:30-11:00am.
<br>
If you need to see me outside office hours please send me an email
to arrange a suitable time.
<br>
</li><li> Web material: lecture notes, assignments, tutorials, 
sample programs, practice problems, etc, when available will be accessible through
<a href="http://csciun1.mala.bc.ca:8080/~gpruesse/teaching/422/notes"> 
 http://csciun1.mala.bc.ca:8080/~gpruesse/teaching/422/notes </a>
</li></ul>

<p><b>Timetable and assessment</b><br>
</p><ul>
<li> Lectures: Tue, Thurs 2:30 -- 4:00 Bldg 210, Room 240 (except October 24 and 31, when we 
go to 360/323). 

</li><li> Labs/Tutorials are held in Bdlg 210, Rm 260 (on Thursdays), Bdlg 210, Rm 240 (on Fridays)
       <br>Occasionally we may meet instead in the lab (315/115), by prior arrangement.
</li><li> Assessment:
Students will be required to do an individual project.  
There will be at least one midterm test, and several assignments, including some programming assignments.<li> 
<!--<br>
20% paper/project
<br>
5%  presentation of project
<br>
25% midterm (in November)
<br>
20% assignments 
<br>

</li>

</ul>

<p><b>Tutorials</b><br>
You must be enrolled in, and fully participate in,
the weekly tutorial/lab sessions to pass the course.
<br> Each tutorial may involve study questions, 
and/or practical problems (programming, design, debugging, etc),
and may be specifically geared towards helping solve the current assignment.

</p><p><b>Computer accounts</b><br>
To work on your tutorials and assignments, you will 
be given accounts for the computing science labs.
<br> There is a user id and password associated with each account
(to prevent others from reading your mail).
<br> The appropriate use of these accounts will be discussed in your
first tutorial.

</p><p><b>Assignment notes</b><br>
Each assignment has a due date and time.
Assignments must be submitted before the due date and time, using
the submission process which will be discussed in the class
and lab sessions.
No other method of submission will be accepted.  Late assignments will be accepted for 
up to two days after the deadline, with 10% penalty for each day late.
<br>
Assignment marking will be based on the correctness of your solutions,
the quality of your code and supporting documentation, and adherence
to standards and restrictions which will be specified on an
assignment-by-assignment basis.
<br>
<b>You are required to cite any works you used in constructing the solution you 
submit, including helpful discussions with other students, online sources, emails, etc.</b> 

</p><p>
<b>Grading</b>
<br>
There will be small, frequent assignments, and a couple of larger ones.  They will in total
count for 30% of the grade.  
Each assignment will have a weight, so that longer or more challenging assignments can be 
given weight in accordance with the amount of effort I believe they take.  This system allows
the instructor to assign problems as they emerge naturally from the material we cover.  Most
will be handed in on hardcopy.  
<br>
<b>You must pass the final exam to pass the course.</b>
<br>
<br>
35% Final exam
<br>
30% Assignments
<br>
20% Midterm October 22
<br>
14% Paper/Project/Presentation
<br>
1% Class participation/Oral Interview

<br>
<br>
<u>Appeals of Grades:</u>
Any exercise or examination grade may be appealed.  However, the
appeal must be made to the instructor, in writing and attached to the
work in question, and within 7 days of the graded work being returned or available.
The instructor reserves the right to re-grade
the entire piece of work submitted on appeal, not necessarily
just the component that the student believes is in error.

</p><p>
<u>Grade Conversion:</u> The following scale will 
be used.

</p><p><b>Guidelines Concerning Fraud</b><br>

These guidelines concern the type of fraud
where a student presents another's work as
his or her own, or allows another to do so.
</p><ul>
<li>As fraud invalidates the evaluation of a student's progress,
it is the duty of instructors, teaching assistants,
and laboratory assistants to take measures
to prevent fraud and to be vigilant towards symptoms of fraud.
</li><li>Students are encouraged to discuss the material of the course together.
<b>Students may discuss assignments but no written material or record of any kind
shall leave such discussions with any party.  </b>
<br>  This includes emails and texts -- by their nature, they leave a written record, so are not permitted.

<br><br>
All submitted work in this course is to be executed individually.
You must understand your submitted work; if you don't, it cannot
be considered your work, and you grade on the work can be 
changed accordingly.  
<br><br>
As in all academic endeavour, due credit must be given to
all reference material.  Students should consult the
course instructor if they are not certain which
outside material is appropriate for use in a course.

<br>
</li><li>In case fraud is detected, credit is withheld
from the work affected.  The students involved are
reported to the department chair who may take additional
disciplinary action commensurate with the severity of the
fraud and the past records of the students.
