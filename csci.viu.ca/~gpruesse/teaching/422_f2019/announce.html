<h3>Course Announcements
</h3>

<p>
Anything new and of sufficient consequence (such as cancellations, updates to assignments, etc.)  
will be emailed to the class.
Such emails will arrive at the email address that is indicated at your Student Record.  
Announcements with lasting significance will also be posted here.

      <b>Nov 19:</b>  Class will be either foreshortened or cancelled, and a reading (from CLRS)
      will be assigned.  I will post here which it is to be, once I have figured out travel to Vancouver 
      for the VEF: The Entanglement of AI, ML, and Quantum Computing<br>
      <br>
      <b>Results for Lab6</b>: A few things of note from students who have completed the lab.
      <br>1. If you run <tt>bump</tt> on otter you will get about 3 x the running time as on 
      the cubs.  Don't know why. (Thanks, Cole.)
      <br>2. If you use deques (double-ended queues -- also defined in STL) instead of vectors for the 
      list of upper-cover lex numbers, you will cut your running time in about half.  (Thanks, Cole.)
      <br>3. If you sort the elements in the deque of upper-cover-lex numbers before 
      you compare, your running time on pos.25000.treduc will be 30 x higher.  But if you do
      your pushes to the correct end of the deque in the right order, the values will be sorted so 
      you don't have to. 
      (Thanks, Tony.)

      <b>Tutorial</b>: This week there will be <b>No</b> mandatory tutorial.
      However, there will be a group office hour in the tutorial room.  
      Do the handout self-quiz, and if you have forgotten (or never learned)
      some of the material on it, come to the office hour/tutorial and we'll
      go over subjects you missed or have forgotten.

      Here are some sample inputs and outputs:

      $ ./mmopt 8 10 11 12 3 2 9 8 7

      <br>
Note that, by changing "&lt;" to "&gt;", we can find the optimally <it>bad</it> rather than good way of parsing the matrix chain. For example, the same matrix chain below 
can take either 608 scalar multiplications, or 45,680 scalar multiplications, depending
on how you parse the matrix chain!

<tt>
$ ./mmopt 15 2 20 2 20 2 20 2 20 2 2 20 2 20 2 20

      "The Transitive Reduction of a Directed Graph" by Aho, Garey, and 
      Ullman (1972 SIAM J Computing).  In this paper, they prove that 
      if there is a O(n<sup>&alpha;</sup> algorithm to find the transitive 
         closure of a graph, then there is a O(n<sup>&alpha;</sup> algorithm
         to find the transitive reduction of the graph. (Also vice versa?)
