Construct the relevant table for finding the optimal 
order to perform matrix multiplication of four matrices, 
of dimensions 3 x 11, 11 x 14, 14 x 2, 2 x 6.
What is the worst case number of scalar multiplications required?
<li>
Give a Dynamic Programming algorithm that finds the largest Independent Set
in a rooted tree.
<li>
Given an n x n boolean array Less[n][n], where Less[i][j] means 
element i &lt; element j, 
but Less is not guaranteed to be transitively closed or transitively 
reduced, show how to find either the transitive reduction or the
transitive closure of Less.

<li>
Suppose you have a topological sort input that consists of 
four independent chains, two of length two and two of length one. 
What is the Information Theoretic Lower Bound on the number of 
comparisions needed by a comparison-based sort to sort the data
into a linear ordering?

<li>
Binomial Heap practice:
Construct two binomial heaps on 10 and 11 keys, respectively. Show the
merge of the two.  Now do a DeleteMin.

<li>
Fibonacci Heap practice:
Given the following keys to insert in the following order into an 
initially empty Fibonacci Heap:
<br>
1 9 4 8 3 2 6 7 12 13 10 5 11 15 14
<br>
What does the FibHeap look like after the inserts?  Suppose you now execute
FindMin -- what does it look like?
Suppose you now execute a DeleteMin -- what does it look like?
Now delete as many items as you can without provoking a Consolidate. 
What does the FibHeap look like?
Now make one more Delete in the largest tree in the heap.  What does the 
result look like?
<br>
<li>
Consider our Assignment 2 data structure, consisting of 
an array A of sorted lists, where each list A[i] is either empty or 
is contains 2^i elements. Let's call them FullLists. 
Consider if we maintained a collection of FullLists.  
What would the merge operation on two FullLists consist in -- 
i.e., write the pseudocode.  What is the actual running time? 
What is the amortized running time of 
Mergeable FullLists, including just the operations Insert and Merge? 
Assume that you start with empty FullLists.
What is the amortized running time of FullList operations, if 
the operations are Insert, Merge, and Find?
