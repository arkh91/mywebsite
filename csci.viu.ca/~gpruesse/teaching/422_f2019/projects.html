Computer Science 422: Possible Project Topics </h2></center>

</center>

To pass the course, you will need to research an algorithms topic, write up your research, and 
present the results to the class. 
<br>
<br>
You can choose to emphasize coding a solution, or you can do algorithms research, wherein you 
undertake original algorithms research.  The balance of how much code and how much theory 
is your choice.  You will be graded on your acheivements.  If the scope is too small but all correct, you may not get as good a mark as if the scope was more ambitious with partial success 
painstakingly reported and analyzed. 
On the other hand, more students make the mistake of aiming to widely.  In algorithms research, it is
fine to start with a problem and as you run into roadblocks you refine your problem down to a 
case you can actually solve.
